Here is where my HackerRank problems are housed. This repo is for personal use, but if you see a problem you're not sure about, feel free to take a look at my approach and solution!

Most problems are created with a simple Java class, with an included main method (psvm).

Comments will instruct the reader on thought processes/solutions or examine difficult code bases I have trouble with.

I am not a superDev. I am and will continue to be a student of the form of Web Development no matter how many years pass.

Keep coding!
